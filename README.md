# PDC-Project

Currently need to list down all the websites where we can scrape the websites
listed down some  
Website | Pros | Cons | Difficulty
Skyscanner | Easy to search ANY route; API-like structure | Some bot detection | Moderate
Google Flights | Very rich data; many airlines | Heavy JavaScript, dynamic loading | Hard (needs Selenium)
Momondo | Simple interface; shows many prices together | Some popups/redirects | Easy
Kayak | Shows flexible dates, cheap days | Anti-scraping if too fast | Moderate
Expedia | Famous; flights + hotels bundles | Cluttered page, harder to parse | Moderate-Hard
FlightAware | Shows real-time flights | Focuses more on actual flights, not ticket costs | Moderate
Travelocity / Orbitz | Expedia-owned, similar | Same issues | Moderate
CheapOair | Special deals; multiple airlines | Ads and distractions | Moderate
Kiwi.com | Flexible routes search | Complex HTML DOM | Moderate
Hopper | Good for predictions | No easy public scraping | Hard (app-based mostly)


currently need to setup a mongoDB connection 
and setup a naive scrapper to test 
Selenium
